## Dependencies
sqlite3

## Installation
Simply let the script run in the background following the same steps as any other ros enabled program.

## Logging
Place a subscriber in the listener function with the following format:
	
rospy.Subscriber('/TopicName', TopicType, savePacketCB)

The incoming packets will be saved in a database where the script is located. The table name is going to be identical to the packet's type.

Thus packets that share the same type share the same database table.

## Synchronization
Following the above steps, the packet should include a seq, and uid field. An example is provided.

The packets are propagated and synchronised based on their packet type. It is necessary that a topic shares the name of the type of packets it handles. 

Thus if we have the following packet;

Hardware.msg

that is published to the following topic;

/Robot1/Hardware

then the specific packet will also be propagated to the following topics;

/Robot2/Hardware
/Robot3/Hardware
/Car1/Hardware
